<title> hangman game </title>
<h2> How to play:</h2>
<body>
The computer thinks about a word. 
<br>
In the box you can write letters and the computer will check if your letter is in the word.
<br>
If your letter is in the word the computer will change the underscore to the letter you wrote.
<br>
If your letter isn't in the word the computer will draw a part of the man.
<br>
To win you need to discover the word before the man is hanged.
<br>
If the man is hanged you lose the game.
<br>
Good luck!
